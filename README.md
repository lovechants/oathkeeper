This is just a simple tui tool for having a timer + simple todo notes box

Just to help with staying focused for periods of time in terminal when not using tmux to track time 

May update it with features as needed. 

Written in go with bubbletea, opposite of [Aliyah](https://github.com/lovechants/Aliyah/tree/main) which uses rust and ratatui

## How to use 
```bash
git clone 
go run . #if you want to run it in the directory only 
```

```bash
git clone 
go install # if you want to run system wide 
```
> If you haven't added the Go bin directory add it to your shells config file
```zsh
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
source ~/.zshrc #if using zsh but you get the idea
```
